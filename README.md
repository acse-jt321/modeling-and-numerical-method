# Modelling and Numerical Methods

This repository contains all the lecture and study materials for Modelling and Numerical Methods, November-December 2021.

## Aims

Part 1: introduce mathematical essentials and physical equations for modelling a range of dynamic processes 

Part 2: provides complementary background on numerical methods that can be used to solve the equations of these physical systems

## Structure

Part 1 (week 1-2): Tensors, conservation principles in continuum mechanics, examples of fundamental fluid dynamic problems and solutions. Coursework 1 (Timed Remote Assessment)

Part 2 (week 3-4): Numerical methods to solve continuum mechanics problems: FD, FEM, FVM. Coursework 2

## Schedule

Links to the class materials will be posted here in due course
