# Modelling and Numerical Methods

This repository contains all the lecture and study materials for Modelling and Numerical Methods, November-December 2021.

## Aims

Part 1: introduce mathematical essentials and physical equations for modelling a range of dynamic processes 

Part 2: provides complementary background on numerical methods that can be used to solve the equations of these physical systems

## Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of this module, students will be able to:
1.    Derive the fundamental governing equations of continuum mechanics.
2.    Relate the continuum descriptions of deformation and stress to the fundamental governing equations of continuum mechanics.
3.    Consider the application/solution of appropriate governing equations of continuum mechanics.
4.    Critique the key numerical approaches for the solution of problems from continuum mechanics.
5.    Contrast the fundamental properties of different numerical algorithms: stability, accuracy, consistency, convergence, and boundedness.
6.    Describe and implement numerical methods to solve Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).
7.    Apply knowledge of spatial and temporal discretisation
methods and their properties.

## Synposis

This module will introduce the key concepts and algorithms required to represent the continuous world through conservation laws, differential equations, and after their discretisation on discrete computers.  Fundamental concepts that are common across all numerical methods will be introduced:  stability, accuracy, consistency, convergence, boundedness, conservation, etc. 

In order to describe problems governed by continuum mechanics, vector and tensor calculus will be reviewed. The kinematics of continuous media, including material vs spatial descriptions and tensor strain measures will be introduced, as will stress principles, including the Cauchy stress tensor, and various tensor stress measures. Derivation of the conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy will be conducted and constitutive equations describing material response will be introduced.

A wide range of algorithms for the numerical solution of ODEs (implicit and explicit) and PDEs (mesh and particle based) will be introduced.  These will be motivated by the physical problems introduced in the continuum mechanics part of the module with an emphasis on computational fluid dynamics, and looking ahead to future modules (and their associated coursework) as well as final research projects in this area.

## Structure

Part 1 (week 1-2): Tensors, conservation principles in continuum mechanics, examples of fundamental fluid dynamic problems and solutions. Coursework 1 (Timed Remote Assessment)

Part 2 (week 3-4): Numerical methods to solve continuum mechanics problems: FD, FEM, FVM. Coursework 2

## Assessment

The module will be assessed through two pieces of coursework. The first coursework will be a Timed Remote Assessment time TBC. The second coursework will be released on the Thursday of the fourth and final week of the course, for submission on Friday 10th December.
